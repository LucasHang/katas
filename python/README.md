# Pyhton

Python I'm still learning and really enjoying it, but since I'm not an expert, I'll probably only make one implementation, in the first I'll just start developing and along the way I'm going to fix all things I studied about, then in the second one I will try to improve the first implementations given that, in theory, I'm more capable of.

### Scripts

- To run the project `python main.py`
- To run the tests `python -m unittest discover -v`
