Typescript is a language that I know better, so I use it for develop a variety of solutions for the proposed kata and then use those to make analogies with new languages.

Some implementations I want to try:

### Design as you code

I'll just start developing and designing the proposed kata without too much contemplation. It will probably be a very raw version

### Design patterned

In this one I will try to uso some more complex patterns to improve de raw version, a refactored implementation

### Clean Arch

The master piece, in this one I will use all my strength and knowledge to implement the most clean and optimized version (probably using event-driven)
